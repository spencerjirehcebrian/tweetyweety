<h1>Understanding Modern Web Architecture</h1>
<p class="byline">By Alice Engineer</p>
<div class="content">
<p>Modern web applications have evolved significantly over the past decade. From simple server-rendered pages to complex single-page applications, the landscape has changed dramatically.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Component-Based Architecture</h2>
<p>Component-based architecture has become the dominant paradigm for building user interfaces. Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte have popularized this approach, allowing developers to build reusable UI components that encapsulate their own state and behavior.</p>

<h2>Server-Side Rendering vs Client-Side Rendering</h2>
<p>The debate between SSR and CSR continues, but modern frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt offer hybrid approaches that combine the best of both worlds. Server components allow developers to render parts of their application on the server while maintaining interactivity on the client.</p>

<h2>Edge Computing</h2>
<p>Edge computing has introduced a new paradigm where computation happens closer to the user. This reduces latency and improves the user experience, especially for global applications.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The modern web continues to evolve rapidly. Staying up-to-date with these architectural patterns is essential for building fast, reliable, and scalable web applications.</p>
